Iamque ibat dicto parens et dona Cupido 695
Regia portabat TyriiS‚ duce laetus Achate.
Cum venit, aulaeis iam se regina superbis
Aurea composuit sponda mediamque locavit.
Iam pater Aeneas et iam Troiana iuventus
Conveniunt, stratoque super discumbitur ostro, 700
Dant famuli manibus lymphaS‚ Cereremque canistris
Expediunt‚ tonsisque ferunt mantelia villis.

Cura penum struere, et flammis adolere Penates;
Centum aliae totidemque pares aetate ministri, 705
Qui dapibus mensas onerent et pocula ponant.
Nec non et Tyrii per limina laeta frequentes
Convenere, toris iussi discumbere pictis,
Mirantur dona Aeneae, mirantur Iulum
