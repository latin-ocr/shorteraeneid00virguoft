Semineces volvit mult05‚ aut agmina curru

plucked a magio herb, a leaf of dz'ttany‚ and unseen
dropped z‘t in tlte vessel of water by leis side. As Iapis
bathed the wound tlzerefrom‚ suddenht the pain left
Aeneas, tlte blood was stanched, and of its own accord
tlze arrow came ίξεηίζγ out. “ No skill of nzz'ne,'’ crz‘ed
Iapis, “ lzas worked this marvel. ’Τίς Heaven has pre-
served thee for yet greater deeds,''

Ille avidus pugnae suras incluserat auro 430
Hinc atque hine, oditque moraS, hastamque coruscat.
Postquam habilis lateri clipeus loricaque tergo est,
