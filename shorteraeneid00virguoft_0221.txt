THE SHORTER AENEID 1 93

BOOK III

6. Antandros, a town at the foot of Ida, on whose slopes grew
timber for their ships.

91. Lz'mz‘naqff, a quite unusual liberty of scansion, though
frequent before double consonants, such as pr-‚ tr-, cl-, etc.

154. Ortygia = Delos.

163. Hesperia, literally, “ the land of the evening '² (Gk. ἑσπέρα
=vespera), “ the west,” i.e., Italy.

165. Oenotri, originally a tribe of South Italy.

180. ambiguam, geminos, because the Trojans were descended
either from Teucer or Dardanus.

202. Palinurus. See 1. 513 and V, 840, seq.

319. As it stands the line is beautiful (see Page, ad loc.).
But Conington reads Andromachen, followed by a question
mark, and governed by revisit in 1. 318. One hopes he is wrong.

321. virgo, Polyxena, slain by Pyrrhus on Achilles' tomb.

340. Editors try to repair this line, and even Page will not
admit that Virgil left it so on purpose. But may not the poet
picture Andromache as speaking haltingly from emotion?

343· Cf- XII, 440·

424. Milton in portraying sin has in mind Virgil's description
of Scylla. Paradise Lost‚ ii, 650.

442. Averna, sc„ loca, “the region of Avemus,'' a lake near
Cumae, of sulphurous waters, whose exhalations could kill a
bird flying over it. Hence it was a suitable place in which to
locate the entrance to Hell.

484. cedit honori (so MSS.), “flags not in honouring him ’²
(Conington); literally “ yields not to the honour ’² (due to
Ascanius). Others render “yields not to the generosity'' (of
Helenus). Others read honore, “ yields not in doing honour.’'

489. Astyanax, her son and Hector’s, had been slain at the sack
of Troy by Ulysses, who cast him down from a tower.

497. affigam, see Narrative, l. 344, seq. Xanthus was a river
of the Troad.

517. Oriona. This scansion (spondee in the §th foot) is usu-
ally confined by virgil to Greek words, as here.
