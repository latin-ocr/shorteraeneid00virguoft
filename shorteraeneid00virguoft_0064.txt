36 THE SHORTER AENEID [111. 90·153

“Vix ea fatus eram: tremere omnia visa repente,
Liminaque laurusque dei, totusque moveri 91 .
Mons circum, et mugire adytis cortina reclusis,

tree and herb. Anchises, in tlzis grievous pass, bade me
return to Delos and again enquire of tlze oracle whitlzer
we must turn our steps.

“ Nox erat, et terris animalia somnus habebat:
Effigies sacrae divom Phrygiique PenateS,
Quos mecum a Troia mediisque ex ignibus urbis
Extuleram, visi ante oculos adstare iacentis 150 Δ
In somniS, multo manifesti lumine, qua se
Plena per insertas fundebat luna fenestras;
Tum sic adfari et curas his demere dictis:
