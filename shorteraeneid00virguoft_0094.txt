66 THE SHoRTER AENEID [v. 52·127 ’

Argolicove mari deprensus et urbe Mycenae,

Annua vota tamen sollemnesque ordine pompas
Exsequerer, strueremque suis altaria doniS.

Nunc ultro ad cineres ipsius et ossa parentiS, 55
Haud equidem sine mente reor, sine numine divom,
Adsumus et portus delati intramus amicos

Ergo agite, et laetum cuncti celebremus honorem . . .
Prima citae Teucris ponam certamina classis; 66
Quique pedum cursu valet, et qui viribus audax

Aut iaculo incedit melior levibusque sagittiS,

Seu crudo fidit pugnam committere caestu,

Cuncti adsint, meritaeque exspectent praemia palmae.
Ore favete omneS‚ et cingite tempora ramiS.’' 71

72-12 3. All did as lze bade, and thronged to Anchises' ³
tomb, where after due observance Aeneas greeted the
spirit of lzz's father. But from the grave there glz'ded
forth a snake, with spotted back and glorians scales of ἶ
gold, which tastea' of tlte sacrifice, and then stole harm- ¹
lessly away. Scarce knowing if it were the genius qf the
place or his father's familiar spirit, Aeneas repeated liis ,
sacrifice, and all brought their several offeringS. ,

And now the appointed day for the Games was come.
The prizes were set forth for all men to see—cauldrons
and garlands, armour and fine raiment, talents of silver
and of gold. T he four competitors for tlte Ship-Race
were called out, the Sea-Serpent of Mnestheus, tlte
Chimaera of GyaS, Sergestus’ Centaur, and the Scylla ,
of Cloanthus.

Tranquillo silet, immotaque attollitur unda
