IX. 501-612] THE SHORTER AENEID 139

Ilionei monitu et multum lacrimantis Iuli
Corripiunt‚ interque manus sub tecta reponunt.

503-602. But the trumpet loudly called to battle.
Wz'tlz nglzt and main the Volsci strove to breach tlze
wall or find an unguarded approach. But tlze Trojans
. were too well used to defending a beleaguered city, and
tlte Rutulians sared no better in their attempt at escal-
ade. lee brunt of the battle centred round a tower on
the wall ‚· ere long Turnus contrz'ved to set it on fire,
driving fortlc the defender5‚ except a few who were
hurled headlong when at last z't fell. Two only of
these escaped,· Helenor, his shz'eld as yet unblazoned‚
turned recklessly on the surrounding foe, to mreet a
glorz'ous death in his first battle: the other, Lycus, fled
and tried to scale tlte wall to safety‚ but Turnus caught
lzz'm as he hung, and slew lzz’m, with a scornsul gz'be.
lez'cker grew tlze fight, more terrz'ble tlze slaughter on
either side. ’T was lzere that Ascanius first drew bow
in earnest‚ and at his first essay slew Numanus, wlzo
lzad been tauntz'ng tlte T rojans with shameful words.
“ Ah! thgz'ansj’ he cried, “ besieged this second time!
What madness drove you hz'tlcer, where ye shall not find
the sons of Atreus, nor lyz‘ng Ulysses .-

“ Durum ab stirpe genus natos ad flumina primum
Deferimus saevoque gelu duramus et undis;

Venatu invigilant pueri, silvasque fatigant3 605
Flectere ludus equos et spicula tendere cornu,

At patiens operum parvoque adsueta iuventus

Aut rastris terram domat, aut quatit oppida bello,
Omne aevum ferro teritur, versaque iuvencum

Terga fatigamus hasta; nec tarda senectus 610
Debilitat vires animi mutatque vigorem:

Canitiem galea premimus; semperque recentes
