the friends who disobeyed the poet’s instructions for
preserving one of the most perfect of all works 01
art.

While the exquisite poetry of Virgil and the ro-
mantic story of the Aeneid are in themselves sufficient
to place him among the immortaIS, we shall miss much
of the true greatness and beauty of the poem if we
