among poets to rely on the famous legends of Greece.
Greece was peculiarly rich in mythology, and it must
further be borne in mind that Roman literature, more
especially poetry, was not in the main a national
growth‚ but borrowed its formS, ideaIS, and themes
from Greece. The Latin epiCS, therefore, which re-
sulted from this tendency were far from being national
in tone. They might have a beauty and romance of
their own, but it was the beauty of a hothouse plant,
not of an indigenous growth. Thus it was that when
virgil stepped into the field, Rome had no great
narrative poem that could be regarded as satisfying
the ideals of patriot and artist alike. It is not the
least of Virgil’s many claims to immortality that he
, should have found a theme which satisfied both these
demandS, and that by his remarkable originality of
treatment he should have produced an epic which,
while nominally concerned with the events of the
legendary past, was yet the epic of all Roman his-
tory. He did more than this. For, while he produced
a poem which is the greatest of all national poemS, he
also contrived to satisfy the literary taste of the day
which demanded Greek colouring and Greek myth-
ology.

out the least basis in actual fact, that the Romans
traced their origin to a band of Trojan exiles under
the leadership of AeneaS, one os the few heroes
who survived the sack of Troy by the avenging
Greeks This is not the place to trace the origin of
the legend. It is sufficient here to say that its spread
seems in the main to have been due to the ingenuity
