THE SHORTER AENEID 209

679. morte, grammatically goes with pati, but in sense with
quicquid acerbi est, ‘⁸ to suffer all death’s sting.”

718. mussant, cf XI, 345, note.

723. Daunius. Explained by 1. 934, infra.

847. Z’Zdem, cll X, 487, note.

889. If only Aeneas would resrain from talking in the battle!
Turnus' reply in 894-5 is a more dignified utterance, and is at

,least provoked by his opponent.

916. tremescit, i.e.‚ he fears: and thus telum instare can be
construed “ the threatening of the spear'' (accusative after “he
fears '’).

920. sortitus, i.e., “ scanning him to mark the fortunate place
for his blow.'’ ⁷

940. sermo, z'.e.‚ Turnus' words had all but influenced him.

942. balteus. See X, 496.

952. With the death of Turnus the Aeneid ends immediately.
To some readers, the hero of the Poem is dead3 and very
properly “the rest is silence.'' Roman readers would mark the
death of Aeneas' rival, whether hero or villain3 and thence-

forward the path of Aeneas would be straight, and therefore
dramatically uninteresting.
