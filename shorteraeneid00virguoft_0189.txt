THE SHORTER AENEID 161

rites for all the slain. The pyres were set, the dead
placed thereon, with the armour they had taken from
the foe. All day the living watched the funeral fires of
the dead, until once more night studded the sky with
gleaming stars. Elsewhere, the Latins did honour to
their dead ‚· some few were carried to their own homeS,
but most were burned upon the field, an indiscriminate

· company of the slain. Loudest were the lamentations in
the city, loud the demand that Turnus must himself
come out to battle, he who was the cause osso much woe.
Drances clamoured more than all, that Turnus, only

I n the mz'dst of the clamour the embassy returned from
Diomede with naught accomplished‚· nor tears nor

dregs the cup of punishment, scattered o'er the earth,
exiles and wanderers‚ some of them slain by foul treach-

but in peace, with these newcomers from T roy.’'

daunted race whom no defeat can quell. As fhr us, our
last hope has failed. I blame not any man, sor each has
done his part,· but all our strength is forespent. Far to
the west, beyond the Tiber, I have lands of hill and dale
where the Trojans may dwell in peace and build their city.
These we will yield to them‚· and if they ask new lands
