208 THE SHORTER ΑΕΝ EID

BOOK XII

5. ille practically corresponds to the Elizabethan “ your '’—
“your wounded lion.'’ Less colloquially, T. E. Page translates
“look you.''

13. pater, cf. V, 521.

17. ‘⁴ Or let him rule the vanquished, and Lavinia be yielded
to him as his bride.''

26. Admittedly an ugly line in its elision. hauri is impera·
tive. For the phrase ef. X, 648.

250. improbus. See X, 727, note.

322. pressa, z‘.e., hidden‚ suppressed.

329. semineces is the predicate.

337. This picture of Mars, with Fear and Wrath and Treason
as his attendants, is taken direct from Homer (Iliad, iv, 440).

434. summa, i.e., lightly kissing his lips through his raised
Vizor.

435. Ajax had bidden his son, in well-known wordS‚ to be
“more fortunate than he, but in all else like him ” (Sophocles,
A jax, 554). Virgil, then, imitates other writers besides Homer
and Ennius, as the notes of many voluminous editors abund·

antly prove.

440. Repeated from ΙΙΙ, 343.

623. See 468 (summary, ad init).

641. UfenS, l. 460, supra.

644. Drancis, XI, 336 seq.

648. anima. Nominative‚ despite the long final a, long only ¹
by an exceptional metrical licence. The alternative, which ⁴
scans istim, is no easier. Munro skilfully interposes an unelided 9
interjection (a !) between anima and atque, which would be a}
quite normal licence. ‚¹

675. pontes, “gangways '² on the movable engine used in
sieges. They were lowered onto the walls, and over them, as
by a bridge, the assailants passed.

678. stat, z‘.e., my resolution is firm (impersonal‚ as in 11, 750).
