XII. 72¹·724] THE SHORTER AENEID 183

Cornuaque obnixi infigunt, et sanguine largo
Colla armosque lavant3 gemitu nemus omne remugit:
Non aliter Tros Aeneas et Daunius heros

Concurrunt clipeis ; ingens fragor aethera complet.

725-842. While Jupiter wezghed in the balance the

, sates of these two men, Turnus struck full at Aeneas ‚-

but the treacherous blade lent by his charioteer was
shz'vered on the shz‘eld, and Turnus flea' persone, dartz‘ng
this way and that, for all around were soeS. S till
Aeneas pressed hard in pursuz't, for all his wound‚ like
a houna' upon the trach of a deer, while Turnus vaz'nly
cried out sor his own good swerd. But none dared help
him. At last they came to a wz'ld olz've-tree, z‘n which
Aeneas' spear was burz'ed deep. Eagerly he strove to
pluck it forth and cast z‘t at his enemy, while Turnus
prayed to Faunus to hold fast the steel. The god gave
ear to hz’s entreatz'es‚ so that Aeneas could not prevaz'l to
draw z't forth ‚· but while he wrenchea' and struggled,
once more J uturna assumed the lz‘keness of M etiscu5‚ and
brought to Turnus his own trusty swora'‚· and Venus
gave power to Aeneas to draw out his spear at last. So
now the two stood face to face once more.

For the last time Jupiter spake to sun0. “ Surely 'tis
time to end thz‘ne enmity to Troy. Enough of mournz'ng
has been achz‘eved by thy fierce wrath. I will no longer
suffer thee to have thy wz'll.” Submz‘ssz’vely did suno
make answer to him, confessing all her deeds. Yet one
request she made, and then would yz‘eld ,· that when the
warring natz'ons joined z’n amz‘ty, the names of Latium
and Rome nght for ever endum, and Troy's abhorrea'
name should be blotted out of remembrance. And] upz’ter
replz'ed: “ I grant thy prayer. The T rojans shall be
merged z‘n the new race that shall arise, of Latin speech
and name. And of all peoples of the earth none shall
more loyally venerate thy name.''
