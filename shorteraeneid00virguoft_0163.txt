1x. 367-382] THE SHORTER AENEID 135

295-366. Iulus vowed that Euryalus’ mother should
be as his own to him, and, come what might, the promise
should endure. As a pledge he gave him his sword‚·
others a lion-skin and helmet‚· and all the company
escorted them without the camp.

Silently they reached the hostile lines, where all was
wrapped in sleep. Euryalus kept watch and ward behind
v them, Nisus first assailedproud Rhamnes, whose power
os augury stood him in no stead that night,· and after
him many another Rutulian, master and man. As a
hungry lion among the sheepfolds, so Nisus raged and
slew ; Euryalus scarce less than he. At last, as dawn
approached, Nisus bade his friend forbear, and together

they left the sleeping camp, arrayed in spoils of the
s ain.

Interea praemissi equites ex urbe Latina,

Cetera dum legio campis instructa moratur,

Ibant et Turno regi responsa ferebant,

Ter centum, scutati omneS, Volscente magistro, 370

Iamque propinquabant castris muroque subibant,

Cum procul hos laevo flectentes limite cernunt,

Et galea Euryalum sublustri noctis in umbra

Prodidit immemorem radiisque adversa refulsit.

Haud temere est visum. Conclamat ab agmine Vol·
scens: 375

“ State, viri; quae causa viae? quive estis in armis?

Quove tenetis iter? ’‘ Nihil illi tendere contra,

Sed celerare fugam in silvas et fidere nocti.

Obiiciunt equites sese ad divortia nota

Hinc atque hine, omnemque abitum custode coron-
ant. 380

Silva fuit late dumis atque ilice nigra

Horrida, quarn densi complerant undique sentes;
