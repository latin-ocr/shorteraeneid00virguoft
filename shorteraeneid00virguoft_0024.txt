kingdom, as the counterpart of the Iliad, though we
cannot confine the influence of the Iliad or the Odyssey
to any one portion of the poem. Aeneas takes the
place of Achilles, Turnus of Hector. The gods take
sides as in the Trojan war. Juno is the relentless
enemy of the TrojanS‚ Venus their protector and
helper. It is true that for the most part the super-
natural interventions in the Aeneid strike us as frigid
and artificial and in some cases as absurdly un-
chivalrouS. But we must remember in the first place
that such intervention was an established feature ol
epic‚ which Virgil could scarcely have avoided; and
secondly‚ we must bear in mind that he used this
device for a special purpose. The Aeneid is the epic
of the foundation of that state which was eventually
to become the ruler of the Western world. It is the
poet’s aim to show us Rome’s future greatness in the
germ and to lay stress upon her imperial destiny.
And by the intervention of heaven in the struggle he
seeks to emphasize the fact that the Romans were a
“ chosen people‚'' specially selected on account of their
aptitude for the great career that was before them,
while incidentally he pays a lofty compliment to the
ruling dynasty of the Julian house. They are de-
scended from a goddess and have been chosen by
heaven to work out the salvation and the regenera-
tion of Rome. In AeneaS‚ the great ancestor of the
CaesarS, he attempts to typify the Roman ideal, the
“happy warrior.” The word in which he continually
sums up his virtues is pietas. For this there is no
exact equivalent 1n English. It has a far wider mean-
ing than our English‘ ‘piety'', ·the nearest equivalent
