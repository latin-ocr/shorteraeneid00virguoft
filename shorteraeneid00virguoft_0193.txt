ΧΙ. 438-306] THE SHORTER AENEID 165

Ibo animis contra, vel magnum praestet Achillen
Factaque Volcani manibus paria induat arma

Ille licet. Vobis animam hanc soceroque Latino 440
Turnus eg0, haud ulli veterum virtute secundm,
Devovi. ‘ Solum Aeneas vocat.' Et vocet oro;

Nec Drances potiu5‚ sive est haec ira deorum,

Morte luat, sive est virtus et gloria, tollat.”

445 -497. As thus tlte Latins wrangled in debate‚ tlze
news came that Trojans and Etruscans were set in battle
array. “ To arms! to arms! ’' tlze cry went up‚· and
bitterly scqffed Turnus: “Aye‚ prate of your peace, wlzile
the foe assail your city! '’ but, scoffing, turned to post his
captains at their stations. The old man Latinus dis-
missed the councz'llors, and sadly reproached himself for
scorning the proffered friendslzip of Aeneas. M ean-
while with might and main all strove to build up their
desenceS, men and women and children alike, in that
last extremity ,· all save Lavinia, the hapless cause ofsuclc
disaster, who with her mother prayed in the temple qf
tlte gods tlzat her people might even now be delivered.
Clad in full panoplia Turnus was raging for the fray,
restless as a horse turned loose among the pastures by
cool waters tlzat he loveS.

Obvia cui, Volscorum acie comitante, Camilla
Occurrit, portisque ab equo regina sub ipsis

Desiluit, quam tota cohors imitata relictis 500
Ad terram defluxit equis; tum talia fatur:

“ Turne, sui merito si qua est fiducia forti,

Audeo et Aeneadum promitto occurrere turmae
Solaque Tyrrhenos equites ire obvia contra.

Me sine prima manu temptare pericula belli: 505
Tu pedes ad muros subsiste, et moenia serva.''
