x11.⁶14-⁶1⁶] THE SHORTER AENEID 179

468- 5 53. But juturna took the reins in place of
Metiscus, T urnus' charioteer, and to and fro amidst the

„ fray she drove his chariot, twisting and turning like a

swallow that darts here and there in search of foodfor
her young. Relentlessly Aeneas followed every turn, but
still juturna delivered her brother from combat. At
last Messapus aimed a shaft at Aeneas and grazed his
. plume ,· whereat in wrath Aeneas forsook his pursuit of
Turnus to deal slaughter in the thickest of the fight.
No pen can tell the tale of them that fell before Aeneas
and Turnus in their rage. None that stood in the path
of either lived to tell of it. And over all the field the
two hosts fought, each mansor himself, without stop or
stay.

5 54—61 3. But Venus put it into the heart of Aeneas to
deal a sudden stroke at the undefended city of Latinus.
Swiftly he called his captains and unfolded his plan—-
to leave off following Turnus and burn the hostile city
with fire. Straightway the assault began upon the city,
within whose walls discord arose,· for some would man
the defenceS, some would yield to the foe,· and all was
uproar and confusion, as it ngrht be a swarm of bees
whose hive some shepherd has discovered and filled with
smoke.

W ithin the palace the queen, Amata, watched the
enemy draw near, yet nowhere could descry the form of
Turnus. Persuaded of his death, she cried aloud that
she was the cause of all this woe, and madly hanged
herself from a beam. There Lavinia found her, and
lamentation arose throughout the city. With raiment rent

and dust upon his head Latinus bowed beneath the
wezght os calamity.

Interea extremo bellator in aequore Turnus
Palantes sequitur paucos iam segnior, atque 615
Iam minus atque minus successu laetus equorum.
