their journey. After due ceremonias, Aeneas bade fare-
well, giving the women to Acestes' care, and tlte ships
stood out to sea. ”

779-826. Meantime Venus sought out Neptune, and
thus bewailed: “ The insatiable wrath of J uno, and her
unbroken spirit, send me suppliant to ἤια,- for still she
lzarries tlze wretched remnant of the Trojans‚· see what
a tempest she made to wreck their ships! see how she
goaded their women to fire tlze fleet! And now Ipray
thee, grant them safe passage to the T iber.'' Neptune

bade her rernember bow often he had befriended Aeneas
by land and sea, smoothing the billows before him or

cloaking lzirn in a mist from the onset of Achilles. “ So
now will I save him, bnt one life must be sacrificed in
his stead.’' And on he passed in lzz's chariot, escorted by
all spirits of the deep, and ocean grew calm before their

feet.

Hic patris Aeneae suspensam blanda vicissim

Gaudia pertemptant mentem 3 iubet ocius omnes

Attolli maIOS, intendi bracchia velis, . . . 829

Princeps ante omnes densum Palinurus agebat

Agmen; ad hunc alii cursum contendere iussi.

Iamque fere mediam caeli Nox humida metam 835

Contigerat; placida laxabant membra quiete

Sub remis fusi per dura sedilia nautae:

Cum levis aetheriis delapsus Somnus ab astris

Aera dimovit tenebrosum et dispulit umbraS,

Te, Palinure, petenS‚ tibi somnia tristia portans 840

Insonti; puppique deus consedit in alta,

Phorbanti similis, funditque has ore loquelas:

“ Iaside Palinure, serunt ipsa aequora classem ;

Aequatae spirant aurae; datur hora quieti.

Pone caput, fessosque oculos furare labori. 845
