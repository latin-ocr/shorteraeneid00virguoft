206 THE SHORTER AENEID

727. improbus is used of anything incorrigible, excessive, un-
conscionable; e.g.‚ Amor, anser (who will not be sated), rabies,
labor (in a good sense—that will not be beaten), Jovz's ales (XII,
250), mons (XII, 687), etc.

745. dura quieS, a fine and simple “ oxymoron '’ (or expression
in which the two words are apparently contradictory). Once
more 1 venture to quote the unpublished translation of a very
great teacher (cf note on VI, 743):

“ Ungentle peace and iron sleep sealed up
Orodes’ sight. . . .'’

829-830. With the same words Camilla seeks to console a
fallen foe in XI, 689. One does not fancy that Aeneas’ words
could be anything but very cold comfort. The last line of the
Aeneid would well describe the dying man's emotion.

860. maerentem, cf. Sokrab and lemnam, 727 seq„ for a like
moving picture of the horse.

880. nec divom parcimus ulli, z‘.e.‚ if your gods come to help
you, them too will 1 slay.

887. silvam, z’.e., a bristling “ thicket '’ of arrows.

900. quid increpitas? Why indeed? yet neither Homer nor
Virgil feels any discredit in the victor’s boasting3 nor perhaps
do we when the scoundrel is slain (eg, Macaulay‚ Horatius,
stanza xl, “ Lie there, he cried, fell pirate '’). But Mezentius has

won every English reader's sympathy in lines 8 58-866, if nowhere
else3 and so the boasting jars on us.

BOOK XI

8. Bellipotens, z'.e.‚ Mars, the Lord of War.

15. rege=lllezenlia

48. See V, 730. In all this passage Aeneas' attitude is un-
selfish‚ and does much to repair the injury done to his fame by
his behaviour (in Book IV) to Dido, and his ungenerous words
to a fallen foe (IX, 897).

68. CJI Sohrab and Rustum‚ 841, seq.
