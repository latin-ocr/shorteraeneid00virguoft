134 THE SHORTER AENEID [lx. 280-294

spearss Nisus and Euryalus begged admittance on
business of great moment. Leave asked and granted,
Nisus unfolded his plan. “ The Rutulian camp is
wrapped in sleep, and guarded ill. We have spied out
our way in many a hard day’s chase ere this. Grant us
leave to seek out Aeneas in the city os Pallas ‚· for right
soon will we return victorious,'’ Old Aletes was deeply
touched by such devotion ,· surely Heaven would never
destroy a race wherein hearts beat so high as this!
“ What guerdon shall Ijudge fitting for such worth? '’
he cried‚· “ As H eaven shall reward z‘t in good time,
even so shall Aeneas, well I know.” Ascanius confirmed

his words, and swore to give them glorz'ous reward, is

they should bring his father back alive. “And thou, my
friend,'' he added, “ thou shalt be my chosen comrade

henceforth in every venture,· in thee is all my trust for
help in word or deed.''

Contra quem talia fatur 280
Euryalus: “ Me nulla dies tam fortibus ausis
Dissimilem arguerit; tantum fortuna secunda
Haud adversa cadat. Sed te super omnia dona
Unum oro: genetrix Priami de gente vetusta
Est mihi, quarn miseram tenuit non Ilia tellus 285
Mecum excedentem, non moenia regis Acestae.
Hanc ego nunc ignaram huius quodcumque pericli

est

Inque salutatam linquo; Nox et tua testis
Dextera, quod nequeam lacrimas perferre parentis,
At tu, oro, solare inopem, et succurre relictae. 290
Hanc sine me spem ferre tui: audentior ibo
In casus omnes.'' Percussa mente dedere
Dardanidae lacrimas; ante omnes pulcher Iulu5,
Atque animum patriae strinxit pietatis imago
