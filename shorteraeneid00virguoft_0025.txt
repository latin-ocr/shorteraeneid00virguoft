INTRODUCTION xix

would perhaps be “devotion to duty.'' Aeneas is the
man of destiny. But he is so because he resolutely
pursues in the face of all obstacles the path marked
out by his duty to heaven and his duty to man. He
saves his father, he saves his country's gods from the
ruin of Troy, and all his Subsequent career is one

Δ long obedience to the call of his conscience and his

high destiny. Even in his desertion of Did0‚by which
he goes far to forfeit the reader’s sympathy, he is re-
luctantly obeying the command of heaven. His sin
is, for Virgil, not the forsaking of Dido, but his for-
getfulness of his high calling. Such was Virgil's aim
in the portrayal of Aeneas, That the portrait is a
success as a whole can scarcely be maintained, though
Virgil is neither the first nor last great writer who has
failed to make his hero convincing. Aeneas too often
seems little better than a puppet whom the poet has
draped with the appropriate virtues, He actS, no
doubt, as he ought, but fails to win our respect or
affection by doing SO. He lives before us as a man
of flesh and blood all too rarely‚ and it is hard to
become enthusiastic over a mere type without a de-
finite human individuality. NevertheleSS, though in
too many passageS, taken by themselveS, Aeneas
wearies us and leaves us cold, he has his nobler
moment5‚ and, if only we bear Virgil's purpose in
view, does contribute to the national significance of
the poem as a whole. For in him is typified and
shadowed forth, however inadequately, the genius of
Rome; he embodies the force which is shaping the
power of a great nation‚ and his continued presence
on the stage lends unity to the poem.
