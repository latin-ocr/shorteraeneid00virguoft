VIII. 520-534] THE SHORTER AENEID 123

443-519. T lze Cyclopes fell to work without delay,·
gold and copper flowed in streams, iron was smelted in
thefurnace‚· bellows roarea', and anvils rang to rhythmic
blows.

Meanwhile dawn and the song of birds awoke
Evander, wlzo with Pallas souglzt out Aeneas; and him
they found walking with his trusty Achates “ Great
T rosan leader‚'' said Evander, “ ’tis but little our aid
can avail tlzee against tlte enemies that lzem us in. Yet
J bring help from a powerful people. For Etruria has
cast off the grievous yoke of Mezentius and has rebellea'
against lzim. May Heaven one day requite upon his
own lzead the hideous cruelties and shameful deea's that
he has done! But now lzis people¹ have come hitlzer and
clamour for thy aia' in vengeance on the tyrant who
shelters now with Turnus. All these will I put under

thy command, for their own sootlzsayerforbia's an Italian
leader. As for me, I am old, and Pallas is son of an
Italian mother.’'

Vix ea fatus erat: defixique ora tenebant 520
Aeneas Anchisiades et fidus Achates;

Adgnovit sonitum et divae promissa parentis,
Tum memorat: “ Ne vero, hospes, ne quaere profectO,
Quem casum portenta ferant: ego poscor Olympo,
Hoc signum cecinit missuram diva creatrix,
