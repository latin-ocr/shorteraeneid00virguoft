v111. 320-336] THE SHORTER AENEID 121

Arma Iovis fugiens et regnis exsul ademptis, 320
Is genus indocile ac dispersum montibus altis

Composuit, legesque dedit, Latiumque vocari

Maluit, his quoniam latuisset tutus in oris, ⁴
Aurea quae perhibent, illo sub rege fuere

Saecula: sic placida populos in pace regebat; 325
a Deterior donec paulatim ac decolor aetas

Et belli rabies et amor successit habendi . . .

Me pulsum patria pelagique extrema sequentem
Fortuna omnipotens et ineluctabile fatum

His posuere lociS‚ matrisque egere tremenda 335
Carmentis Nymphae monita et deus auctor Ap0110.”

awe to the rustz‘cs, who knew not which (ff the gods
dwelt therein, though the rumour ran that Jupz'ter’s
awful form had there been seen. Presently they reached
Evandests lowly dwellz'ng and saw cattle browsz'ng
where now stands the Roman Forum. “ Through this
humble door,'' saz'a' the K ing, ‘⁶ Hercules once passed.
Learn thou to scorn rz'ches, and not a'z'sa'az‘n the low
estate.’' T herewz'th he set Aeneas upon a conch of leaves
and skins,

While nzgrht’s sable wings enfolded earth, Venus, in
anxietyfor her loved Aeneas, spake to Vulcan, her lord‚·
and she, who throughout the T rojan wars had asked no
aid of his, now beggea' from him arms for her son to
wear against his gatherz'ng enemz‘eS. With snowy arms
she fondled him, and readz‘ly he yieldea' to her caress,·
gtadly he promised whatever his art could sashz'on for

hler son. Leanz'ng on his fair queen's breast, he sanh to
