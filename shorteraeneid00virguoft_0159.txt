1x. 74-149] THE SHORTER AENEID 131

Atque omnis facibus pubes accingitur atris,
Diripuere focos; piceum fert fumida lumen 75
Taeda et commixtam Volcanus ad astra favillam.

7 7-125. Surely the Trojan ships had been destroyed,
butfor a marvel that befell. Long years ago, when first
Aeneas’ fleet was in building, Cybele the mother of the

⁴ gods had entreated of Jupiter that he should render the

timbers indestructible by storm or· flood. But he had
refused to alter the fixed laws of nature,· for indeed, he
could not,· but he vowed that when the ships reached
Italy he would transform them into sea-nymphs. And
now the day was come for their deliverance. Suddenly
a bright light shz'ned upon the combatants, and an
awful voice was heard: “ T rojans, sear not‚· for Turnus

may not burn the fleet. Go free, ye ships, sea-goddesses
henceforth.'’ And straightway every vessel slipped her
cable and dived like a dolphin‚· then they rose to the
sufface in maiden-shape and swam out to sea.

The Rutulians stood aghast,· T iber himself shrank
bach and stayed his course ,-

At non audaci Turno fiducia cessit;

Ultro animos tollit dictis, atque increpat ultro:

“ Troianos haec monstra petunt; his Iuppiter ipse
Auxilium solitum eripuit, non tela ¹neque ignes
Exspectant Rutulos Ergo maria invia Teucris, 130
Nec spes ulla fugae ; rerum pars altera adempta est;
Terra autem in nostris manibus; tot milia gentes
Arma ferunt Italae. Nil me fatalia terrent,

Si qua Phryges prae se iactant, responsa deorum. . . .
Sed VOS, o lecti, ferro quis scindere vallum 146
Apparat et mecum invadit trepidantia castra?

Non armis mihi Volcani, non mille carinis

Est opus in Teucros, Addant se protinus omnes
