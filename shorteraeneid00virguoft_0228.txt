200 THE SHORTER AENEID

743. quisque . . . Manes. (i) “We bear each one ot us our
own ghostly doom” (Page); (ii) accusative of respect, “ we each
suffer in our own spirit '’ (Conington). A well-known rendering
of a great teacher is: “Each one his own purgation must
endure.''

745-747. Clearly Virgil's idea is that of a Purgatory which
only persectly cleanses a few. But all souls are capable of re·
incarnation after the period of purgation. aurai, an archaic form
of the genitive aurae. Cf. VII, 464.

847-853. These lines, ostensibly a prophecy, are written by
Virgil as a summary of the genius of his nation during its
700 years of history. The Greek could, it is true, “fashion
breathing bronzes'' more skilfully, and Rome could nowhere
rival Grecian art. Yet no people ever built more durably than
Romans, and none drove roads through trackless places as they
did, though certainly the latter was a great part of their plan
for “ ruling nations under their dominion.''

85 5. Marcellus was the last of the three Romans to win the
spolia opima, which he did in 222 13.C.‚ during the first of his five
consulships‚ slaying the opposing Gallie commander with his
own hand. Quirinus= Romulus.

865. quantum instar, i.e.‚ “what a presencel’' The youthful
figure (whose name is not revealed until l. 883) is Marcellus
nephew and adopted son of the Emperor Augustus, who de-
signed him to be his heir3 but he died in 23 B.c.‚ aged only
twenty.

882. Wagner’s fine punctuation is here adopted, instead of the
more usual, but dull, comma after rumpas, which makes the
sentence conditional and almost meaningless; for there was no
“fate to break down.'' He was fated to be born on earth, this
fair youth of promise; but who is he? the reader asks; and
Virgil keeps the open secret for nearly twenty lines. Not only
was the poem written for Augustus to read, but tradition makes
Virgil read it aloud to Augustus and his sister Octavia, mother
of the young Marcellus
