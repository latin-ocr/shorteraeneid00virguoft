INTRODUCTION xxi

fire. On the shield of Aeneas as on the shield os
Achilles are represented a number of sceneS. But
whereas in the Iliad they are scenes of the occupa-
tions of everyday life, in the Aeneid they are drawn
from Roman history. In one the Capitol is saved
from the Gauls by the warning of the sacred geese.

ἱ In another we see the crowning victory of Actium,

where the fleet of Augustus and the forces of law and
order, crushed the navies of Antony and Cleopatra,
and Italian civilization triumphed over the pomp and
licence of the East. It is passages such as these
which more than anything else make the Aeneid
something more than a mere story. But the national
purpose runs through every book of the Aeneid, and
is emphasized by a thousand subtle toucheS. All
lovers of poetry will find much in the Aeneid to
delight them by sheer beauty. But unless the whole
purpose of the poem be borne steadily in view, they
run the risk of missing many of its beauties and fail-
ing to appreciate much of its true greatness The
Aeneid is not only one of the most beautiful of
poems; it is also the one true epic of a nation’s great·
ness that the world has seen or is ever likely to see.
