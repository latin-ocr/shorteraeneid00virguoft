vi EDITOR'S NOTE

proper nameS‚ have been added. Itis hoped that such
a system may make it possible for many to read a
good deal of Virgil who might otherwise read none,
and yet to gain the impression (not to be derived
from mere “selections'’) that the Aeneid is a com·
plete poem with one uniform plan and purpose. And
it is certainly better to read four-sevenths of the
Aeneid than none at all.

For the rest, the value of Literature does not
necessarily consist in its difficulties, You may often
gain a finer view of the Alps from some summit
attained with moderate toil than if you make haste to
rise up early and scale with infinite labour the Dent
Blanche or the Matterhorn, To scale the nobler
heights is, indeed, the better part ; but there are
glories to be seen and keen delights to be enjoyed by
those who cannot aspire to the full adventure.

Throughout‚ both in the idea and in its execution,
I have had the advantage of continual help from Pro-
fessor Butler, even down to the smallest details of
proof-correcting. Discerning readers of the book
should ascribe to him what merits it may posseSS‚ to
me the faults that remain. For these latter Professor
Butler must in no sense be held responsible: they
will doubtless be found in those places where I have

neglected to take his advice.
