THE SHORTER AENEID 207

82. caeso sanguine, an inversion for “ the blood of the slain.''

89. Cf. X, 860, note. Aethon, literally, “the blazer'’--a fiery,
reddish-brown horse. one supposes.

17 5. armis=“sr0m their arming.'⁷
345. mussant, literally, “murmur,'' and here implying “ hesi·
tate'' to speak aloud.

346. flatus, “let Turnus abate his swollen pride.'’

370. adversum may be construed with hostem or pectus, with
’ equally good sense.

386. Inszgnis is a verb, ‘⁶ ennoble.’'

396. Bitias et Pandarus. See IX, 603-721 (summary).

399. capiti Dardanio, i.e., for the ears of Aeneas to hear.

438. animis, an ablative of manner, “With high heart will 1
go to meet Aeneas.'’' praestet (says Conington) may= (i) exhibeat,
or (ii) superet.

444. luat, sc., iram deorum, ‘⁴ assuage their wrath.’'

513. quaterent, “ (bidding them) barry our fields.'' Praemisit
implies a command and so takes the construction of such verbs.

581. The free and untamed childhood of Camilla may remind
the reader of Wordsworth’s Lucy, sharply contrasted as the two
would be. Of Camilla, Virgil here writes that “many a Tuscan
mother vainly yearned for the maid to wed her son,'' whereas

Lucy's maidenhood was unremarked by scheming matrons or
aspiring lovers:

“She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,

A maiden there were none to praeli-e,
And very few to love.''

678. Iapyge, i.e., Apuliam

822. partiri, “historic'' infinitive, common in vivid descrip-
tions, but quite unusual in mere parenthesis such as this.

831. This line is repeated as the closing words of the Aeneid.
