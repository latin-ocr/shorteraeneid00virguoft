giam, z'n his cave, the terror of tlte countrysz'de. On a
day came Hercules hz‘tlzer with cattle that he had lz’fted
from Geryon, and fed them on Tiber's bankS. But Cacus
- filled the measure of his crimes by stealing four of these.
Hercules pursnea' lzz'm to his cave, but could not force the
great door tlzat V ulcan had made for his gz'ant son. At
last he found the lzuge beetlz'ng crag tlzat formed tlte
cavern’s roof. Wz'tlz ηαξ-1η ana' main Hercules sent z‘t
craslzing down the steep, and Cacus’s den was revealed
to view, as though tlze eartlz should gape and the depths
of Hell be uncovered. Hercules leapt upon the monster,
ana' strangled him, and dragged him forth into the lzjglzt
of day, for us to behold wz'tlz fhar and wonderment.
Wherefore from that day forward we celebrate eaclz

Exin se cuncti divinis rebus ad urbem
Perfectis referunt. Ibat rex obsitus aeVO‚
Et comitem Aenean iuxta natumque tenebat
Ingredien5‚ varioque viam sermone levabat.
Miratur facilesque oculos fert omnia circum 3¹0
AeneaS, capiturque loci5‚ et singula laetus
Exquiritque auditque virum monumenta priorum.
Tum rex Euandrus Romanae conditor arcis:
“ Haec nemora indigenae Fauni Nymphaeque tene·

ban&

Gensque virum truncis et duro robore nata, 315
Quis neque mos neque cultus erat, nec iungere taur05‚
Aut componere opes norant, aut parcere parm,
Sed rami atque asper victu venatus alebat.
Primus ab aetherio venit Saturnus OlympO,
